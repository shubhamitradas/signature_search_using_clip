OpenAI's CLIP neural networks is able to transform both images and text into the same latent space, where they can be compared using a similarity measure.
Handwritten signature detection in a legal document took 3 months in 2018-19, while CLIP made it possible in a few hours without any finetuning.
This will hugely bring down the cost and effort for document processing pipelines.
